(CNN)At no stage do advertisers or sponsors -- who pay to associate their products or services with editorial content -- have a say in which stories CNN covers, which people CNN interviews nor how we present our editorial content on television and/or online. Sponsors do not review nor approve any content before or after it airs or is published. Editorial content, even when sponsored, is commissioned and produced solely by CNN editorial staff or freelance contractors commissioned by CNN editorial staff. It complies with the same editorial guidelines as non-sponsored articles and video.
